# Sinking-Dissipation

Hot and thick custard air holds the mind in its grip,    
thoughts trapped like barron Munchhausen in a sluggish mire    
entirely without traction, nor hope, with the sleeplessness    

Here it all is, all possibility, caked in mud, sinking      
Salvation may be one cry away, but the will is not there      
Dignity and reason keeps nature from its mission        
For there is no tomorrow without the trace of every other day          
              
Mire, swallow this soul in your embrace         
Birds up high, rock sanity asleep, with a lifelong lulluby            
       
Rest now tired eyes,      
let asphixiation hail no pain or panic             

Body be relaxed           
Mind be empty         
Soul be fluid        
            
And Heart.. fret not, your work is done,           
And though time will out-pace you,         
your echo is infinite            

Self, you stubborn memory, do not cling,            
Leave nothing for death to auction
